# Adaptive FabLab letter of intent

My intent is to co-create an adaptive technology fabrication laboratory (FabLab)
at the Pearl Buck Center. This is a collaborative civic project serving the
mission of Pearl Buck with four initial efforts in 2019.

-   Prototype adaptive vocational rehabilitation (AVR) software and hardware to
    serve the needs of Pearl Buck clients.

-   Establish a fabrication laboratory space to build and test the hardware and
    software.

-   Collaborate with workforce advocates, schools, manufacturing industry, and
    the maker community to evaluate programming to establish talent pipelines.

-   Explore income streams by selling the AVR and leveraging the small batch
    manufacturing capabilities of the FabLab.

We'll launch this as an open project following Mozilla Open Leaders guidance
with an eye toward designing for inclusion and collaboration. Mark Davis will be
donating 2-4 hours a week performing leadership, programming, designing and
creating hardware, wrangling donations of tools, equipment, and volunteer time
when needed to complete projects. Pearl Buck will provide shop space with power,
venting, plumbing, storage and access. Staff time will be required keep Mark
productive and work on these projects as well. So far we are reserving Wednesday
afternoons as on-site work sessions while communicating online at other times.

We aspire to be a full-service FabLab with 3D printers, CNC Routers, laser
cutters, etc eventually. The first pieces of equipment to acquire will be HDMI
monitors and a 3D printer for prototyping the adaptive vocational rehabilitation
software and hardware. Pearl Buck should not have any additional expenses to
support the FabLab. Mark is willing to personally donate or find donors for all
the needed equipment, tools, and materials. Pearl Buck will provide
administrative support when needed to process donations.

Many of these terms are very specific and require some definition.

-   adaptive: specific to the needs of people with special needs. For example,
    the Xbox adaptive controller is specifically designed to help folks pay game
    would could not otherwise using stock controllers.

-   Fabrication: creating controller buttons and such using manufacturing
    equipment.

-   Small batch manufacturing. Taking orders and fabricating batches for clients
    who can't afford industrial manufacturing batch sizes.

-   Talent pipeline: training for underemployed folks in the skills needed to
    either work at the shop, or transition to other employment in the
    manufacturing or tech sectors.
